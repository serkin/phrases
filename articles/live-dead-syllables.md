## Live and Dead Syllables

Every Thai syllable is pronounced with one of the five tones, whether it has a tone mark or not. When there is no tone mark, tone rules apply. In that case, the tone is determined by consonant class and whether the syllable is live or dead.

A syllable that ends with a short vowel or a stop final consonant is called a dead syllable.

A syllable that ends with a long vowel or a sonorant final consonant is called a live syllable.

For now, just consider the short and long vowels, since we haven't introduced final consonants yet.
